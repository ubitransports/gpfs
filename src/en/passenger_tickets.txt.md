ticket_id,passenger_id,fare_id,ticket_start_on,ticket_end_on,restrictions
T0000001,P1,TU1,20160101000000,20160131235959,"[{""line"":{""is"":[""LA"",""LB"",""LC""]}}]"
```

## How Restrictions Work

If the `restrictions` and/or fields `unboarding_restrictions` are filled in, the defined values will replace the restrictions put in place on the fare.  

It is possible to restrict tickets on one or more criteria:

- `network` - transport network (eg: On the school network)
- `line` - line (eg: on line A or B)
- `trip` - trip (ex: on trip 107-03A9)
- `stoparea` - stoparea (ex: stopeare "Gare SNCF")
- `stoppoint` - physical stop (ex: stoppoint "Gare SNCF")
- `zone` - rate zone (ex: in rate zone "A")
- `weekday` - weekday (ex: Monday to Friday)
- `time` - time slot (ex: Between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m.)
- `calendar` - calendar (ex: During school holidays)

Ticket usage restrictions are managed in [JSON format](types.html#JSON).

A restriction is a JSON array of one or more rules: `[REGLE_A, REGLE_B]`
Use of the ticket is authorized if at least one of the rules is valid.

A **r√®gle** is a JSON object of one or more criteria cited above:  `{CRITERE_A:CONDITION_A, CRITERE_B:CONDITION_B}`
The condition is also an object of type `{"is":[REFERENCE_A, REFERENCE_B]}` or `{"isnot":[REFERENCE_A, REFERENCE_B]}`.
